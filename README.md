# React Portfolio

This is my portfolio made using the React framework. Please check it out to view some of the projects I have been working on. You will see a quick bio about myself, the portfolio with some of my highlighted work, a form to contact me, and a link to my resume.

I am always looking to collaborate and meet others, so please feel free to reach out!


## Accessing the application

**Deployed Heroku App:** https://bckasper.github.io/react-portfolio/

**Github Repo:** https://github.com/bckasper/react-portfolio


## Instructions for use
**Below is a detailed breakdown of how this application works:**

1. The opening page is the bio about me. Not a whole lot to say! Reach out to learn more.

2. The next page is my portfolio page. Use the navbar at the top right to get to it. You can then see 6 of my projects with links to deployed applications and their respective Github repos.

3. The contact me form will ask for your name, email and a brief message. Please note that each of the fields are required and the email input won't check "green" until you have entered a valid address.

4. The final page is my resume. This is a static resume PDF. I will note that there is a link at the bottom of it to my LinkedIn, which is more likely to stay up to date.

5. Finally, there is a footer with links to my LinkedIn, Github and Stack Overflow profiles.
