          I am a freelance developer that enjoys building beautiful web applications, primarily through JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My applications are often inspired by my love for travel, food and stunning natural wonders. I have been fortunate enough to have a career that has allowed me to pursue these passions and am always looking for ways to collaborate with new people who are driven to pursue theirs with me. 

          On this site you will find a portfolio of my applications and projects. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to collaborate!
